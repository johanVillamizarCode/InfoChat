# InfoChat
_Plugin that allows you to add information commands to your server._

## Detailed description üßæ

It consists of adding information commands within the server (for example:  __!command__ ), which when the client writes it, the information will be printed in the chat. This message will only be seen by the person typing the command.

It is a very useful plugin when players want to know a link, information, etc. What you imagine. 

By default there are three highly requested commands such as the __!discord__ , __!steam__ and __!website__ commands. More commands and variations can be added by modifying the code if you already have knowledge.
